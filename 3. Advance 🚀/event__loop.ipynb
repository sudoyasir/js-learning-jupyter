    "**Event Loop in JavaScript**: The event loop is a core concept in JavaScript, enabling non-blocking, asynchronous execution. It ensures JavaScript can handle multiple tasks concurrently without freezing the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-Threaded Nature**: JavaScript operates on a single thread, executing one piece of code at a timeâ€”known as the \"main thread.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blocking Operations**: Lengthy tasks, like I/O operations, could freeze an application if executed synchronously. JavaScript avoids this by using asynchronous mechanisms like [callbacks](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_callback.asp), [promises](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp), and async/await.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Event Loop**: This loop constantly checks for pending tasks (e.g., callbacks) in the message queue. When the main thread is idle, it picks and executes the next task, ensuring responsive and non-blocking execution.\n",
