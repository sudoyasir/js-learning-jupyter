# JavaScript Learning Notebooks 📚

Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey captured through Jupyter notebooks! 🚀 This repository serves as a collection of my interactive code snippets, experiments, and projects as I delve deeper into the world of JavaScript.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find Jupyter notebooks containing my progress, insights, and challenges as I explore various aspects of JavaScript. From basic syntax and data types to advanced topics like DOM manipulation and asynchronous programming, I aim to document my learning process for both personal reference and to assist fellow learners.

## Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yasir2002/js-learning-jupyter
    
2. Navigate to folder: 
    ```bash
    cd ./js-learning-jupyter
    
3. Node and Jupyter is required to run all the snippets. Download node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en), Jupyter can be installed in VS Code from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

4. Open the project in VS code and easily learn JavaScript executing every example individually.
