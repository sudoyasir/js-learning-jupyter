## Project Description:
- The HTML file (index.html) contains a button to trigger the user data fetch and a container to display the fetched user information.

- The JavaScript file (script.js) handles the asynchronous data fetching using promises (fetchUser) and async/await (fetchUserAsync). It simulates fetching user data from the JSONPlaceholder API.

- The CSS file (styles.css) provides some basic styling to the HTML elements.

## Running the Project:
1. Save the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files in the same directory.

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

3. Click the "Fetch User Data" button to see the asynchronous data fetching in action.

This mini project demonstrates the use of promises and async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations, providing a practical example of fetching user information from an API.
